<h2>List of Undergraduate and Postgraduate Projects</h2>

<p>Below is a list of possible projects for students at Macquarie
University
(ENGG, <a href="http://courses.mq.edu.au/postgraduate/master/master-of-information-technology">MIT</a>,
and <a href="http://www.mq.edu.au/research/phd-and-research-degrees/research-training">MRes</a>). Please
contact me for further details.</p>

<p>If you are pursuing a PhD, the MRes projects can be extended to PhD projects.</p>

<p>If you have a project in mind
which is not listed here but which is related to
my <a href="index.html#researchinterests">research interests</a>,
contact me and chances are that I will be interested too.

<h3>Natural Language Processing for Medical Text</h3>

<p>For more background of the kind of research that I am doing on
Natural Lanuage Processinf for Medical Text, look
at <a href="http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~diego/medicalnlp/">my
research webpage on this topic</a>.</p>


<a name="bionlp12"></a>
<h4>Label the Clusters of Clinical Research Papers</h4>

<p>(MIT, MRes)</p>

<p>We have a corpus of clinical questions and answers. Each answer has
a list of publication references arranged in groups according to how
they address the answer. For example, if the question is "what is the
best treatment for X", and there are three possible treatments, then
each treatment will have a group of references associated to it. The
goal of this project is to automatically produce the key concepts
listed in each group of references by exploring the contents of the
publication abstract in each reference and applying topic labelling
methods. You will need to have knowledge of statistical methods and
natural language processing, or willingness to learn these, and good
programming skills, preferably using the Python programming language
and Python packages such as <a href="http://nltk.org/">NLTK</a>
and <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">Numpy/Scipy</a>.</p>

<a name="bionlp13"></a>
<h4>Find Relevant Medical Publications</h4>

<p>(MIT, MRes)</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to design and apply search technology
so that a search retrieves published medical information that is
relevant to the query asked by a medical doctor. Examples of medical
queries are the titles of
the <a href="http://www.jfponline.com/articles/clinical-inquiries.html">clinical
inquiries column of the Journal of Family Practice</a>. You will use
these clinical inquiries as your source questions, and you will aim to
retrieve documents like those listed in the clinical inquiries, by
accessing the MEDLINE database of medical publications through
interfaces such
as <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed">PubMed</a>. You will
preferably have knowledge and experience with using Web applications,
such as search services. Knowledge of search technology and text
processing is also desirable but not essential.</p>


<a name="bionlp18"></a>
<h4>Evaluate the Quality of a Search of Medical Documents</h4>

<p>(MIT, MRes)</p>

<p>We have a collection of search queries related to clinical
questions and the documents that the search engines returned as
relevant. In this project you will implement methods to automatically
determine how well the relevant documents fit the target topic, and
whether there are any key aspects of the information that are
missing.</p>

<a name="bionlp14"></a>
<h4>Search and Display Clinical Evidence</h4>

<p>(MIT, ENGG805/806)</p>

<p>We are developing technology for searching for medical evidence,
extract the specific evidence related to specific conditions, and
appraise the quality of the evidence. In this project you will
implement an interface to such a technology so that it can be used
from a Web browser. You will need knowledge of Web technology and
applications, and a good sense of Web application design and user
interfaces. There are several aspects of the development that can be
covered in multiple projects: make the system scale up to large
results, enable user login, leverage the use of past queries by the
user or other users.</p>

<h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>

<a name="nlp04"></a>
<h4>Detect Signs of Feelings of Suicide in Social Media</h4> 

<p>(MIT, MRes)</p>

<p>We have a collection of social media posts annotated by the users
with labels like "happy", "sad", etc. In this project you will develop
technology that analyses the messages in order to detect signs of
feelings that might lead to thoughts of suicide. This project is a
collaboration between computer scientists and psychologists.</p>


<a name="nlp03"></a>
<h4>Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning for Question Answering and Summarisation</h4>

<p>(MIT, MRes)</p>

<p>Deep learning and reinforcement learning have recently been used successfully in a wide range
of applications, many of which are related to text processing
tasks. In this project you will explore the use of deep learning or reinforcement learning
techniques (or both) in question answering or summarisation such as in the
shared tasks organised by <a href="http://bioasq.org/">BioASQ</a>. You
will need to have knowledge of statistical methods and natural
language processing, or willingness to learn these, and good
programming skills, preferably using the Python programming language
and Python packages such as
Google's <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>.</p>

<a name="nlp01"></a>
<h4>Machine Learning and Cloud Computing for Text Processing</h4>

<p>(MIT, ENGG805/806)</p>

<p>There is an increasing range of cloud platforms such as Amazon Web
Services, Google Computer Engine, and Microsoft Cloud Platform. Some
of these platforms include specialised components for machine
learning. In this project you will review these platforms and report
on their possibilities for the development and deployment of machine
learning applications for text processing.</p>

<a name="nlp02"></a>
<h4>Make a Chatbot Speak like Donald Trump</h4>

<p>(MRes, ENGG460/411)</p>

<p>In this project you will adapt a full-fledged chatbot such
  as <a href="http://alice.pandorabots.com/">A.L.I.C.E.</a> and make
  it speak in the style of well-known people with strong Twitter
  presence such as Donald Trump. You will apply machine learning
  technology to build language models based on the tweets by the
  target person, and modify the output of the chatbot so that it
  speaks in the style of the person.</p>
