<h2>Summer Vacation Projects</h2>


<p>Every Australian summer (January/February) the Department of
Computing offers a number of vacation scholarships to current students
of the Department undergraduate degrees. Typically the scholarships
cover about 6 weeks of full time work in a specific project. This is
an excellent opportunity to gain working experience, or to test your
research abilities if you are considering doing Honours or a PhD.</p>

<p>Many of the Honours/Masters projects listed above can be adapted to
Vacation scholarships. In addition you could try one of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#afopen">Open Source for AnswerFinder</a></li>
  <li><a href="#afws">Building a Web Service</a></li>
  <li><a href="#af1">A Framework to Test Syntactic Patterns</a></li>
  <li><a href="#af2">Question Classification</a></li>

</ul>

<h4>Open Source for AnswerFinder</h4>

<p>Currently AnswerFinder, our question answering system, uses
proprietary code developed by third parties. The goal of this project
is to replace the proprietary code with open-source code. This will
involve adapting the interfaces of AnswerFinder to the proprietary
modules so that they can handle the new modules. This project is ideal
for people with strong programming skills and interest in working for
an established software project.

<p><strong>Required background</strong>: Good programming skills in
Python or C++.<br>
<strong>Desired background</strong>: Experience with medium to large
software projects.</li>
</p>


<a name="afws"></a>
<h4>Building a Web Service</h4>


<p>The goal of this project is to convert AnswerFinder, our question
answering system, into a Web
Service. The details of how this could be done are available in:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.linguateca.pt/documentos/QolA/defWebservicesQolA.html">Definition of QA systems as Web services</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Required background</strong>: Good programming skills in C++; experience with web technology (e.g. Pass grade in COMP249).<br>
<strong>Desired background</strong>: Experience with XML programming; experience with Web Services.</li>
</p>

<a name="af1"></a>
<h4>A framework to Test Syntactic Patterns</h4>


<p>A Masters student has developed a set of question-answering
patterns as part of her project. The task of this project is to build
a system that tests these patterns on a collection of questions and
answer candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Required background</strong>: Good programming skills, preferably in C++.<br>
<strong>Desired background</strong>: Pass grade in SLP148, COMP248, or COMP348.</li>
</p>

<a name="af2"></a>
<h4>Question classification</h4>


<p>AnswerFinder currently uses a very simple method to classify
questions. The task of this project is to expand the current method by
introducing patterns based on syntactic information and/or machine
learning techniques.</p>

<p><strong>Required background</strong>: Good programming skills, preferably in C++; Pass grade in SLP148, COMP248, or COMP348.<br>
<strong>Desired background</strong>: Experience in programming in a group.</p>
