<h1>Aspectual Composition and Sentence Interpretation: A formal approach</h1>

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>This thesis is principally concerned with aspectual composition. Although
there have been some recent studies on this topic, none has succeeded in
explaining all the different aspectual interactions existing between a verb
and its arguments. This thesis explores the interpretation of sentences
containing transitive or intransitive verbs and their arguments. It is found
that sentence interpretation (in terms of distributive and collective
readings) together with a speaker's linguistic knowledge of the world plays a
decisive role in determining the aspectual interaction between a verb and its
arguments.</p>

<p>An important part in this thesis is the study of predicate properties. The
parallelism between the domain of objects and that of events is stressed by
defining a set of properties which may apply to predicates over both domains,
namely quantisation and homogeneity. The analysis is formalised by means of
lattices which represent our linguistic knowledge of the structure of the
world. Objects and events are categorised by means of predicates, according to
the standard (extensional) definition of a predicate in Predicate Logic.
Quantisation and homogeneity are defined as properties of first-order
predicates, allowing the use of classical deduction procedures to prove the
different aspectual interactions.</p>

<p>These aspectual interactions are possible thanks to the link which exists
between objects and events, which always appears in the semantics of a
sentence. These links are interpreted as thematic roles, although in this
thesis we take a look not at the thematic roles in themselves but at those
properties which license one or another aspectual interaction. The properties
of the thematic roles which are studied here and which are therefore relevant
for the several types of aspectual interactions are very closely related to
the readings of the sentence in the sense of distributivity and collectivity.
There are three types of properties: those involved in a distributive reading;
those involved in a collective reading; and those involved in a gradual
reading (which here is treated as a special reading which shares properties
from both the distributive and the collective readings). Again, as is the case
with predicate properties, the link properties are formally defined by means
of expressions in first-order predicate logic, and the possible aspectual
interactions are demonstrated by applying classical deduction procedures.</p>
