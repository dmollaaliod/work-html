<h2>List of Undergraduate and Postgraduate Projects</h2>

<p>Below is a list of possible projects for Honours and Masters
students at Macquarie University. Please contact me for further
details. Also, if you have a project in mind which is not listed here

<h3>Natural Language Processing for Medical Text</h3>

<p>For more background of the kind of research that I am doing on
Natural Lanuage Processinf for Medical Text, look
at <a href="http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~diego/medicalnlp/">my
research webpage on this topic</a>.</p>

<h4>Topic Modelling for Query-based Summarisation of Clinical Publications</h4>

<p>(Masters or MRes project)</p>

<p>We have a corpus of clinical questions and answers. Each answer has
a list of publication references arranged in groups according to how
they address the answer. For example, if the question is “what is the
best treatment for X”, and there are three possible treatments, then
each treatment will have a group of references associated to it. The
goal of this project is to use topic modelling in general, and
variants of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in particular, to
automatically summarise the texts of the groups of abstracts. You will
need to have knowledge of statistical methods and natural language
processing, or willingness to learn these, and good programming
skills, preferably using the Python programming language and Python
packages such as <a href="http://nltk.org/">NLTK</a>
and <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">Numpy/Scipy</a>.</p>

<h4>Optimisation Techniques for Query-based Summarisation of Clinical Publications</h4>

<p>(Masters or MRes project)</p>

<p>We have a corpus of clinical questions and answers. Each answer has
a list of publication references arranged in groups according to how
they address the answer. For example, if the question is “what is the
best treatment for X”, and there are three possible treatments, then
each treatment will have a group of references associated to it. The
goal of this project is to use optimisation techniques in general, and
Integer Linear Programming (ILP) in particular, to automatically
summarise the texts of the groups of abstracts. You will need to have
knowledge of statistical methods and natural language processing, or
willingness to learn these, and good programming skills, preferably
using the Python programming language and Python packages such
as <a href="http://nltk.org/">NLTK</a>
and <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">Numpy/Scipy</a>. Ideally, you will
also have experience with Integer Linear Programming (ILP).</p>

<h4>Deep Learning for Query-based Summarisation of Clinical Publications</h4>

<p>(MIT, MRes)</p>

<p>We have a corpus of clinical questions and answers. Each answer has
a list of publication references arranged in groups according to how
they address the answer. For example, if the question is “what is the
best treatment for X”, and there are three possible treatments, then
each treatment will have a group of references associated to it. The
goal of this project is to use deep learning to automatically
summarise the texts of the groups of abstracts. In particular, you
will explore topics related to the use of convolutional and recurrent
networks. You will also explore the use of word embeddings for text
summarisation. You will need to have knowledge of statistical methods
and natural language processing, or willingness to learn these, and
good programming skills, preferably using the Python programming
language and Python packages such as
Google's <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>.</p>


<a name="bionlp12"></a>
<h4>Label the Clusters of Clinical Research Papers</h4>

<p>(Masters or MRes project)</p>

<p>We have a corpus of clinical questions and answers. Each answer has
a list of publication references arranged in groups according to how
they address the answer. For example, if the question is "what is the
best treatment for X", and there are three possible treatments, then
each treatment will have a group of references associated to it. The
goal of this project is to automatically produce the key concepts
listed in each group of references by exploring the contents of the
publication abstract in each reference and applying topic labelling
methods. You will need to have knowledge of statistical methods and
natural language processing, or willingness to learn these, and good
programming skills, preferably using the Python programming language
and Python packages such as <a href="http://nltk.org/">NLTK</a>
and <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">Numpy/Scipy</a>.</p>

<a name="bionlp13"></a>
<h4>Find Relevant Medical Publications</h4>

<p>(Masters or MRes project)</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to design and apply search technology
so that a search retrieves published medical information that is
relevant to the query asked by a medical doctor. Examples of medical
queries are the titles of
the <a href="http://www.jfponline.com/articles/clinical-inquiries.html">clinical
inquiries column of the Journal of Family Practice</a>. You will use
these clinical inquiries as your source questions, and you will aim to
retrieve documents like those listed in the clinical inquiries, by
accessing the MEDLINE database of medical publications through
interfaces such
as <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed">PubMed</a>. You will
preferably have knowledge and experience with using Web applications,
such as search services. Knowledge of search technology and text
processing is also desirable but not essential.</p>

<a name="bionlp14"></a>
<h4>Search and Display Clinical Evidence</h4>

<p>(Masters implementation project)</p>

<p>We are developing technology for searching for medical evidence,
extract the specific evidence related to specific conditions, and
appraise the quality of the evidence. In this project you will
implement an interface to such a technology so that it can be used
from a Web browser. You will need knowledge of Web technology and
applications, and a good sense of Web application design and user
interfaces.</p>

<a name="bionlp15"></a>
<h4>Natural Language Interface to Anaesthetic Educational Database</h4>

<p>(Masters implementation project)</p>

<p>We have a database of questions and answers that are used to train
anaesthesists. In this project you will implement natural language
processing techniques that allow a person to type a question and
search for the most relevant entries in the database. You will
preferably have knowledge of information retrieval techniques, such as
Web search, or willingness to learn these.</p>

<a name="bionlp18"></a>
<h4>Evaluate the Quality of a Search of Medical Documents</h4>

<p>(Masters, MRes)</p>

<p>The librarians from the Macquarie University Library have a
collection of queries that they have made to obtain a comprehensive
list of medical documents relevant to a topic. In this project you
will implement methods to automatically determine how well the
relevant documents fit the target topic, and whether there are key
aspects of the information that they need missing.</p>

<a name="bionlp19"></a>
<h4>Evaluate the Quality of evidence of a Medical Document</h4> 

<p>(Masters implementation project)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.georgeinstitute.org.au/">George Institute
for Global Health</a> has compiled a database of medical publications
on physiotherapy, and the quality of the evidence presented in each
publication has been manually assessed according to
their <a href="http://www.georgeinstitute.org.au/">PEDro scale</a>. In
this project you will apply machine learning techniques and find the
best method to determine the quality of evidence in a physiotherapy
publication, according to this PEDro scale.</p>
